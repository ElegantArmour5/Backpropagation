# 🔁 Backpropagation Algorithm – Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a clear and step-by-step implementation of the **backpropagation algorithm**, the core of how neural networks learn by adjusting weights using gradient descent.

## 📄 Overview

The notebook covers:
- 🧠 Manual implementation of a **simple feedforward neural network**
- 🔙 Detailed **backpropagation step-by-step** derivation
- 📊 Forward pass and backward pass computations
- 📉 Weight updates using gradient descent
- ✅ Verification of gradients using numerical checks

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Feedforward neural networks
- Loss functions (Mean Squared Error)
- Chain rule of calculus
- Gradient descent optimization
- Manual vs automatic differentiation

## 🛠️ Dependencies

This notebook requires only:

```bash
pip install numpy
